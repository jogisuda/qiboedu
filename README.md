# qiboedu
Collection of material for quantum computing educational activities using Qibo.
Feel free to explore all the lectures provided by our special teacher: the Qibo mangoose!

---

Like all mongooses it builds its living environment as well-organized burrows arranged on several levels, always remaining alert to its surroundings, observing what is happening to be ready to react.
That's why Qibo the mongoose is the perfect mascot for the Qibo framework, a full-stack project (from hardware to simulation) and with an eye on the latest frontier of research as community and research-driven ðŸ˜„.
