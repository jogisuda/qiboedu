## Bell Inequalities

This folder contains a series of notebooks to explore the popular inequalities concerning quantum Bell states in the context of quantum computing.

The material is organized in three modules of increasing difficulty, and the relative implementation makes use of Qibo basic primitives to instantiate circuits and run them. For further details about how to work with Qibo, please refer to the other tutorials in this repository.

All notebooks are part of the paper [Simulating Bell inequalities with Qibo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01434) (submitted).
